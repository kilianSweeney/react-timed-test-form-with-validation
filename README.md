This is a simple form that requires a few fields be populated before submitting. The id field also requires alphanumeric input. When the form is submitted the list below the form is updated but the new project won't be added if a project with the same id already exists. Clicking on the remove button besides each item in the list removes the item from the list.

I built this app as part of a timed-test challenge to demonstrate knowledge of react and es6.
